# Detect Synthetic News

This project aims at assessing the usage of LLM in the news industry and build a ML project around this topic for learning purposes

## Selection of sources
I restrained the experiment around 3 groups of news actors : newspapers, cable news and tech news.
I selected top news sources based on their reach:
- Top newspapers in the US based on circulation numbers : [article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_newspapers_in_the_United_States)   
- Top cable news based on households reached : [article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_cable_news)  
- Top online tech news based on appearance in search engine results.
